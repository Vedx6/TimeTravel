# TimeChanger

A personal Node.js script to simulate GitHub contributions by generating commits with backdated timestamps.

## Why?

I wanted to learn how Git tracks commits and how to manipulate commit history for fun and learning.

## Technologies

- Node.js
- jsonfile
- moment.js
- simple-git
- random

## How it works

The script writes a JSON file and commits it multiple times with different dates, creating a consistent-looking GitHub contribution graph.

## Future Improvements

- Add more complex commit messages
- Create a GUI for easier use
- Support for different date ranges and patterns
