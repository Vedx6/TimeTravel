# TimeWarp Commits 🕰️🌀

Ever wished you could travel back in time and make your GitHub profile look like you were coding like a mad genius all year long?  
Well, now you can! This wild Node.js script *literally warps time* (or at least fakes it) by creating commits in the past, making your contribution graph look like a hacker’s diary.

## Features

- Generate hundreds of backdated commits with random funky messages 🐙
- Customize your “time warp” window — pick any dates from the past or future (why not?)
- Writes to a JSON file but *makes Git history dance* 💃
- Uses magic libraries: `moment`, `simple-git`, `random`, and a sprinkle of dark coding arts ⚡

## Why?

Because who doesn’t want to look like a coding wizard? Also, it’s a great way to learn Git internals and Node.js scripting without selling your soul.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo (or fork to customize)
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the script and watch your timeline bend:
    ```
    node index.js
    ```

## WARNING ⚠️

This script is purely for fun and learning. Don’t use it to fool recruiters or in professional settings. Time travel is not real (yet).
